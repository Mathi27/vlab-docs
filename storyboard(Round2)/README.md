## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Newton's Ring Experiment

### 1. Story Outline:

The experiment is based on interference of light by introducing change in the medium filling the gap between curved surface of the Plano-convex lens and plane circular glass plate. Student approaches the simulator to understand the concept of interference through experimental setup. The diameters of the Newton’s rings observed are recorded by using cross wire seen through the travelling microscope. The cross wires can be moved by a screw provided.
The objective of the experiment is to find the wavelength of light source and refractive index of the different liquid mediums. The student uses the simulator wherein he selects the medium from drop down list, simulate and verify the results. By performing this experiment the student is able to understand the concept of interference and verify values of wavelength of light and refractive index generated experimentally are compared with the standard literature values.


### 2. Story:

In 1717, Sir Isaac Newton studied the rings pattern generated due to interference of light. These rings are known as Newton’s rings and they arise from the interference of light reflected from the glass surfaces at the air film between the lens and the slide. Newton's Ring Apparatus is one of the basic experiment in Engineering Physics at under graduation level. With the help of this apparatus, the wave nature of light is confirmed and parameters like wavelength of light and refractive index of liquids can calculated. The experiment is based on the phenomenon of interference of light waves obtained from monochromatic and coherent (of same frequency and constant phase difference).
The phenomenon of Newton's ring, is the result of interference between the partially reflected and partially transmitted rays from both the lower curved surface of Plano-convex lens as well as upper surfaces of the glass plate. When viewed with a monochromatic source, it appears as a series of concentric, alternating bright and dark concentric rings centered at the point of contact between the two surfaces. The thickness of the film is symmetrical and increases outwards from the point of contact.
A series of rings are seen around the point of contact between the Plano-convex lens and the circular glass plate. These rings appear in the field of view of telescope. The interference fringe pattern is a pattern of concentric circles, the diameter of which student will measure with a travelling microscope (which has a Vernier scale). The cross wire of the travelling microscope is to be put at the specific ring in tangential position and the reading is to be inserted in the observation table. The readings are to be taken in one direction from left to right or right to left. After filling all the readings, diameters will be calculated. A graph is plotted on which ring number is X-axis and diameter square is on Y-axis. This graph is a straight line having a positive slope, passing through origin. Value of wavelength of light is to be calculated by using the formula.
By studying the ring pattern, we can determine the wavelength of the monochromatic light and also the refractive index of a given transparent liquid medium present in the wedge-shaped film.
The set-up consists of,

Apparatus
1.	Travelling microscope
2.	Plano convex lens
3.	Plane glass plate (optically flat)
4.	Reflector
5.	Sodium light source

With following specifications,

1.	A microscope with x-y-z axes movement
2.	Horizontal measurement scale with fine and coarse movement screw
3.	Cross wire in the field of view for rings diameter measurement
4.	Newton's ring assembly consisting of Plano-convex lens mounted on an optically plane glass plate
5.	Adjustable plane glass plate is provided to be inclined at 45<sup>0</sup> with respect to the vertical plane
6.	Sodium vapor lamp as the monochromatic (5893Å)

The circular glass plate and Plano-convex lens is cleaned and the Plano-convex lens is put over the plate with the curved surface touching the circular glass plate. Monochromatic light source is switched on. A convex lens is placed in front of the source of light. This sends a parallel beam of light. On looking through the microscope, a spot with rings around it can be seen on properly focusing the microscope. By using x-y-z axes movement of the travelling microscope properly resolved rings are in focus, the eyepiece is rotated such that out of the two perpendicular cross wires, one has its length parallel to the direction of travel of the microscope. This cross wire also passes through the center of the ring system. A medium between the plane surface of the circular glass plate and the curved surface of the Plano-convex lens is set from the given list (air, water, kerosene). Now, the microscope is moved to focus on a ring (say, the 10th order dark ring), on one side of the center (say left). The cross wire is set in tangential position to one ring as shown. The least count of the apparatus is noted down as 0.001cm. The microscope readings are recorded. The microscope is moved to make the cross wire tangential to the next ring nearer to the center and the readings are recorded. This is repeated till the 10th dark ring on the right is reached by moving the cross wire with the help of screw.


#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
When the student visits the link of the simulator page, he sees canvas of screen size (a light blue shade). On this canvas all the components in the experimental set up are seen. On top-centre of the screen he observes the title ‘Newton’s ring experiment’. Just below the title user observes an element with two incoming yellow waves and one outgoing yellow wave (i.e. before superimposition and after superimposition). User observes that the amplitude of output wave is the sum of two incoming waves (it is moving towards right with larger amplitude). The user also sees the following things:

•	A blank canvas appears on the screen below the wave pattern. Here the student is prompted to select proper lens and other objects in the set up to drag and drop at proper place as per the experimental setup.
•	Student observes "Switch On" button
•	Student observes a drop down list containing list of medium. The student shall select one medium from air, water, kerosene from the drop down list.
•	Student observes the glass plate in vertical direction so that the student shall set the position of the plane glass plate at 45<sup>o</sup>.
•	Student observes travelling microscope and the rings will appear in the field of view (yellow color, concentric rings with increasing diameters and width of the rings decreases with order, rings become closer together on black background.
•	Student observes the "control" button (button style: two triangles with base adjacent to each other, for increase-decrease). Student continues pressing "Control" button the position of the movement screw of the travelling microscope and puts cross wire at tangential position of the ring and the ring diameter would be noted down.
•	Student repeats the above step to have at least 10 – 12 data points.
•	Student clicks on "Add to readings" button (button style: White outline). The ring diameters are added in the observation table
