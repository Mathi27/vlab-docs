<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
Compensators are used in control system in order to achieve the desired output. A lag compensator is a circuit designed to produce sinusoidal output with a phase lag to the applied sinusoidal input. It is a simple of electrical circuit designed with passive components. Lag compensator consists of resistors R1, R2 and capacitor C.  The resistor R2 is connected in series with C and the corresponding output is measured across this combination by varying the frequency of the input. The frequency response measures the phase lag by measuring a and b from the Lissajous pattern of the output. The lag compensator is reliable, easy to design, increased stability and steady state response of the system is achieved.
